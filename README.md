# Description

Script hook is the library that allows to use GTA V script native functions in custom *.asi plugins.

 

Installation
1. Copy ScriptHookV.dll to the game's main folder, i.e. where GTA5.exe is located.
2. In order to load asi plugins you need to have asi loader installed, you can download it separately or use the latest version that comes with this distrib (dinput8.dll). You must delete previous asi loader (dsound.dll) before using new one.
3. This distrib also includes a sample asi plugin - native trainer, if you need the trainer then copy NativeTrainer.asi as well.

 

Multiplayer
Script hook closes the game when player goes Online, this is done because the game reports installed mods list to R* while being in Online mode.
